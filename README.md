# DMVPN_EVEnG

• Designed and deployed a scalable enterprise network via EVE-NG, using a hub-and-spoke topology to centralize critical resources at the hub site while enabling secure efficient connectivity for 3+ branch sites.

• Implemented DMVPN with IPsec to establish encrypted tunnels over public infrastructure, prioritizing secure site-to-site communication. 

• Configured Crypto ISAKMP policies with AES-256 encryption and SHA-256 hashing to meet enterprise security standards. 

• Enabled inter-domain routing by integrating BGP route redistribution between OSPF and EIGRP.

• Automated network configuration backups via TFTP and implemented SHA-256 cryptographic hashes to validate data integrity.
